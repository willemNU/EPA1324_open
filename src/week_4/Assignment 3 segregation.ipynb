    "## Conceptual description\n",
    "The basic idea of Schelling's seggregation model is quite straight forward. Imagine we have agents organized on a grid. Agents are either red or blue. Agents prefer to be in an environment with agents of the same color, but they are quite tolerant. If the fraction of neighbors of a different color is higher than this tolerance threshold, the agent moves to another free grid cell. At what level of tolerance does segregation occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this basic description, the model is composed of a grid, with one agent per grid cell. This grid is not completely filled because we need to have free space to where an agent can move. Each agent has a tolerance level, and checks when asked if the fraction of neighbors that is of the different type is higher than this tolerance level. \n",

    "## Schedulers\n",
    "A key issue with the Schelling model, and a key way in which this model is different from the various versions of the Axelrod model is that a step by a given agent can change the local environment. Imagine that a given agent checks its neighborhood, decided that the number of neighbors of a different color is higher than its threshold, and thus decides to move to an empty spot. This move changes the neighborhood the agent is leaving. It also changes the neighborhood the agent is moving to. Depending on the order in which agents are activated (i.e. the `step` method is called) different dynamic patterns can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent activation is typically handled through a so-called scheduler. In the Axelrod method, we did this ourself by having a list or set of agents as an attribute on the model. However, we might want to use a more sophisticated class to handle agent activation. MESA comes with a number of schedulers. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  **BaseScheduler**; the base scheduler is nothing but a list and we activate the agents based on the unique ID they have. Internally, base scheduler uses an `OrderedDict`, orded by `agent.unique_id`. \n",
    "* **RandomActivation**; shuffle all agents before activating them one by one in every time step. This is the most often used scheduler in all agent based models. It does introduce yet another form of stochasticity in the model, thus making it necessary to run multiple replications and carefully control the random seed.\n",
    "* **SimultaneousActivation**; a more complicated activation for mimicking all agents moving simultaneously. Rather than having a single step method on an agent, each agent has a staging method and an execution method. You first stage all agents, and then execute all agents. Staging in the context of Schelling Segregation means deciding to move or not. Executing means making the move. So SimultaneousActivation partly solves the path dependency problem mentioned above. Partly, because when moving only a single agent can occupy a given free spot.\n",
    "* **StagedActivation**; A more complicated activation system were agents have not a single step method, but multiple phases of action were each phase needs to be completed for all agents, before moving to the next method. Basically, this is an even more sophisticated extension of SimultaneousActivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model typically has only a single scheduler for all agents, but it is also possible to have multiple schedulers for different agent types."

    "So far, we have run the model for the default values of the parameters `density`, `minority_fraction`, and `tolerance_threshold`. It is quite common in Agent Based Modelling to perform a parameter sweep where one runs the model over a range of parameterizations and analyse the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "MESA support this with a so-called BatchRunner. See the [MESA tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html#batch-run) for details. In short, the BatchRunner allows you to specify a set of values for the parameters you want to vary, fixed values for parameters you don't want to vary, the number of iterations/replications for each run, the number of steps to run the model for, and what statistics to collect at the end of the run. The BatchRunner assumes that a `self.running` attribute is available on the model. This is used to indicate that the model has reached a stable equilibrium and will not change in any subsequent steps. If running is True, the model will still change. If running is False, the model has reached an equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's update our model with this running attribute. What conditions must hold for the model to have reached equilibirum?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement this condition and the running attribute. \n",
    "*Hint:* the scheduler has a `get_agent_count` method\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform a batch run with the following settings. Visualize some results:\n",
    "    * height and width fixed at 20\n",
    "    * density varies from 0.8 to 0.9 with 0.025 increments\n",
    "    * minority_fraction varies from 0.2 to 0.4 with 0.1 increments\n",
    "    * tolerance_threshold varies from 2 to 4 with increment of 1\n",
    "    * 5 replications\n",
    "    * 50 steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* there is a bug in the batchrunner were the column names in the dataframe after the batch run don't match the correct labels. \n"
