    "## Conceptual description\n",
    "The basic idea of Schelling's seggregation model is quite straight forward. Imagine we have agents organized on a grid. Agents are either red or blue. Agents prefer to be in an environment with agents of the same color, but they are quite tolerant. If the fraction of neighbors of a different color is higher than this tolerance threshold, the agent moves to another free grid cell. At what level of tolerance does segregation occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this basic description, the model is composed of a grid, with one agent per grid cell. This grid is not completely filled because we need to have free space to where an agent can move. Each agent has a tolerance level, and checks when asked if the fraction of neighbors that is of the different type is higher than this tolerance level. \n",

    "## Implementing a first version of the model\n",

    "## Schedulers\n",
    "A key issue with the Schelling model, and a key way in which this model is different from the various versions of the Axelrod model is that a step by a given agent can change the local environment. Imagine that a given agent checks its neighborhood, decided that the number of neighbors of a different color is higher than its threshold, and thus decides to move to an empty spot. This move changes the neighborhood the agent is leaving. It also changes the neighborhood the agent is moving to. Depending on the order in which agents are activated (i.e. the `step` method is called) different dynamic patterns can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent activation is typically handled through a so-called scheduler. In the Axelrod method, we did this ourself by having a list or set of agents as an attribute on the model. However, we might want to use a more sophisticated class to handle agent activation. MESA comes with a number of schedulers. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  **BaseScheduler**; the base scheduler is nothing but a list and we activate the agents based on the unique ID they have. Internally, base scheduler uses an `OrderedDict`, orded by `agent.unique_id`. \n",
    "* **RandomActivation**; shuffle all agents before activating them one by one in every time step. This is the most often used scheduler in all agent based models. It does introduce yet another form of stochasticity in the model, thus making it necessary to run multiple replications and carefully control the random seed.\n",
    "* **SimultaneousActivation**; a more complicated activation for mimicking all agents moving simultaneously. Rather than having a single step method on an agent, each agent has a staging method and an execution method. You first stage all agents, and then execute all agents. Staging in the context of Schelling Segregation means deciding to move or not. Executing means making the move. So SimultaneousActivation partly solves the path dependency problem mentioned above. Partly, because when moving only a single agent can occupy a given free spot.\n",
    "* **StagedActivation**; A more complicated activation system were agents have not a single step method, but multiple phases of action were each phase needs to be completed for all agents, before moving to the next method. Basically, this is an even more sophisticated extension of SimultaneousActivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model typically has only a single scheduler for all agents, but it is also possible to have multiple schedulers for different agent types."
