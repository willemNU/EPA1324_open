The model is inspired by a collection of animiations in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) which appeared early during the Covid-19 outbreak. We are going to expand on this by drawing inspiration from [this YouTube movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs).

    "We now have a bunch of balls bouncing around and against one another. We now have to add a few more. pieces to this. First, we need to define the state of the agent (SUSCEPTIBLE, INFECTIOUS, RECOVERED). We can use an Enum for this, similar to what we did in the Schelling model. Second, we need to implement how agents move from one state to the next. When 2 agents bounce against one another, if either of them is infectious, the other also becomes infectious. If an agent becomes infectious, after a random number of ticks, the agent becomes recovered.\n",
